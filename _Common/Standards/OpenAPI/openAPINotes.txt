In OpenAPI(formerly Swagger) schemas, the data types are more specific and tailored to describe API payloads than JSON.
They extend JSON data types and include additional types and formats for more precise API documentation. 

Hereâ€™s an overview of the types supported in OpenAPI:

integer - Represents integer numbers.
Common formats:
    int32: A 32-bit integer
    int64: A 64-bit integer (commonly used for long integers)
Example:
    type: integer
    format: int32

number - Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers
Common formats:
    float: Single-precision floating-point
    double: Double-precision floating-point
Example:
    type: number
    format: double

string - Represents text or character data
Common formats:
    byte: Base64-encoded binary data
    binary: Raw binary data
    date: A date without time (e.g., 2023-01-01)
    date-time: A date and time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2023-01-01T12:00:00Z)
    password: A string intended for passwords (hidden in UIs)
Example:
    type: string
    format: date-time

boolean - Represents true or false
Example:
    type: boolean

null - Represents a null value
Example:
    type: null

object - Represents a collection of key-value pairs, like a JSON object. Can define specific properties and their types
Example:
    type: object
    properties:
    name:
        type: string
    age:
        type: integer

array - Represents a collection of items. Requires an items field to define the type of elements in the array
Example:
    type: array
    items:
        type: string


Additional Formats
In OpenAPI, formats extend the basic data types for more specificity. Common formats include:

uuid: Universally Unique Identifier (e.g., 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000)
email: Email address
uri: A Uniform Resource Identifier (e.g., https://example.com)
hostname: A valid domain name (e.g., example.com)
ipv4: An IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
ipv6: An IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

Key Notes:
OpenAPI focuses on specifying the type and format for precise API interaction and validation.
Types like int or float are combinations of the type and format fields - integer with int32 format, or number with float format
