# Amazon Aurora Serverless data ingestion from Amazon S3

This pattern contains a sample AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) template to deploying an Aurora Serverless Cluster Database, a AWS Secrets Manager entry, a S3 bucket and a lambda function. The Lambda function is triggered by a S3 put object and the handler ingest the .CSV file to AWS Aurora Serverless. With this pattern, an Aurora table called *movies* is created at the first Lambda call and the .CSV is designed according to the movies table.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed
* [Supported features in Amazon Aurora by AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.AuroraFeaturesRegionsDBEngines.grids.html#Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.Serverless) - Ensure that you deploy this pattern on Region that supports Amazon Aurora Serverless

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd aurora-serverless-s3-ingestion/cdk
    ```
1. Create a virtual environment for python:
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
1. Activate the virtual environment: 
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Install python modules:
    ```
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. From the command line, use CDK to synthesize the CloudFormation template and check for errors:
    ```
    cdk synth
    ```
2. From the command line, use CDK to deploy the stack:
    ```
    cdk deploy
    ```

## How it works

-   The VPC and Subnets are created;
-   A RDS security group is created to allow connections at 3306 port from all VPC CIDR range;
-   The Amazon Aurora Serverless Cluster Database is created;
-   An IAM Policy to be used by the Lambda function is created;
-   An IAM Role is created;
-   An S3 Bucket is created and is used as stage to raw data;
-   A Lambda function is create using the same VPC as Amazon Aurora Serverless, with 10 minutes timeout and is triggered by S3 create put on the raw S3 bucket.

## Testing

After deploying this pattern CDK will output two lines:
1. Copy the raw data to Amazon S3 Bucket.
2. Query the database to confirm the data was consumed by Amazon Aurora Serverless.

Example:

```
aurora-serverless-ingestion.S3UploadFileCommand = aws s3 cp ../movies.csv s3://<new_bucket_arn>

aurora-serverless-ingestion.QueryDatabaseCommand = aws rds-data execute-statement --resource-arn "arn:aws:rds:us-west-1:xxxx:cluster:<auro_cluster_arn>" --database "mydatabase" --secret-arn "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-1:xxxxx:secret:<secret_arn>" --sql "select count(1) from movies"
```

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    cdk destroy
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
