io â€” Core tools for working with streams
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Lib/io.py

There are three main types of I/O: text I/O, binary I/O and raw I/O. A concrete object belonging to 
any of these categories is called a file object. Other common terms are stream and file-like object

Independent of its category, each concrete stream object will also have various capabilities: 
it can be read-only, write-only, or read-write. It can also allow arbitrary random access or only 
sequential access (for example in the case of a socket or pipe)
