# Python Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.

## Key Features
- Easy to learn and use
- Interpreted language
- Dynamically typed
- Object-oriented
- Extensive standard library

## Basic Syntax
Python uses indentation to define code blocks:

```python
def greet(name):
    if name:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    else:
        print("Hello, World!")
```

## Data Types
- Integers: `x = 5`
- Floats: `y = 3.14`
- Strings: `name = "Python"`
- Lists: `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`
- Dictionaries: `person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}`
- Tuples: `coordinates = (10, 20)`
- Sets: `unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}`
- Booleans: `is_active = True`
