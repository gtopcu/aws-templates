# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
   - Classification: Predicting a category (e.g., spam detection)
   - Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation)
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment

## Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- K-means Clustering

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision and Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve and AUC
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
