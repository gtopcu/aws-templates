# Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query vector embeddings efficiently.

## What are Vector Embeddings?
Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) in a high-dimensional space.
These embeddings capture semantic meaning, allowing for similarity searches.

## Key Features of Vector Databases
1. **Similarity Search**: Find vectors that are similar to a query vector
2. **Indexing**: Efficient data structures for fast retrieval
3. **Scalability**: Handle millions or billions of vectors
4. **Filtering**: Combine vector search with metadata filtering
