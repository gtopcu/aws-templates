Machine Learning
=================================================================

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
  - Classification: Predicting a category (e.g., spam detection)
  - Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data
  - Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation)
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment

## Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- K-means Clustering

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision and Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve and AUC
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Vector databases
=================================================================

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query vector embeddings efficiently.

## What are Vector Embeddings?
Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) in a high-dimensional space.
These embeddings capture semantic meaning, allowing for similarity searches.

## Key Features of Vector Databases

1. **Similarity Search**: Find vectors that are similar to a query vector
2. **Indexing**: Efficient data structures for fast retrieval
3. **Scalability**: Handle millions or billions of vectors
4. **Filtering**: Combine vector search with metadata filtering

## Popular Vector Databases
- Chroma
- FAISS
- Milvus
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Qdrant

## Use Cases
- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems
- Image similarity
- Anomaly detection
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
