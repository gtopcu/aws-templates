With the 2.0 format version, API Gateway can infer the response format for you. 
API Gateway makes the following assumptions if your Lambda function returns valid JSON and doesn't return a statusCode:

 - isBase64Encoded is false.
 - statusCode is 200.
 - content-type is application/json.
 - body is the function's response.

Lambda response can be text/json:

1.
"Hello from Lambda!"
->
{
    "isBase64Encoded": false,
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "Hello from Lambda!",
    "headers": {
      "content-type": "application/json"
    }
  }

2.
{ "message": "Hello from Lambda!" }
->
{
    "isBase64Encoded": false,
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{ \"message\": \"Hello from Lambda!\" }",
    "headers": {
      "content-type": "application/json"
    }
  }

To customize the response, your Lambda function should return a response with the following format:
{
    "cookies" : ["cookie1", "cookie2"],
    "isBase64Encoded": true|false,
    "statusCode": httpStatusCode,
    "headers": { "headername": "headervalue", ... },
    "body": "Hello from Lambda!"
}
